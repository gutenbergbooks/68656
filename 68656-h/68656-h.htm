<p>Favorite positions for this view are Hennepin View in Prospect Park
and the New Steel Bridge. At the left is the American Fall with Luna
Island and Goat Island dividing it from the Horseshoe Fall. The Maid of
the Mist, near her landing, and the inclined railway are minor objects
of interest.</p>

<p>A trip on the “Maid of the Mist” past the Falls is one of the most
fascinating of the experiences to be had at Niagara. The views of the
descending floods, the swirling water below and the rainbow through the
mist all lend enchantment to the trip.</p>

<p>It is while standing at or near Prospect Point that the very large
majority of people who visit Niagara get their first view of the
wondrous cataract. At one wide sweep of vision Niagara is before you
and you see the water pour over the edge of the precipice, falling with
stupendous power on the rocks below.</p>

<p>Standing on the rocks at the foot of the Inclined Railway in
Prospect Park and looking at the down-pour of water over the American
Fall, a new impression of Niagara’s greatness comes over you, and you
marvel at the beauty of the mighty flood.</p>

<p>Under the light of the full moon of summer time, when Nature has
done her best to make the locality all about delightful, the mind is
made receptive of the moonlight softness, and the beauty of the scene
impresses all with its magnificence.</p>

<p>In winter and summer alike Prospect Point is one of the main vantage
spots from which to view Niagara. Immediately below the Point the
mountain grows to an unlimited size as the spray freezes, and builds it
by night and by day. In the ice bridge season there is no better place
to view it than Prospect Point.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>TERRAPIN ROCK AND HORSESHOE FALL FROM GOAT ISLAND.</p>

<p>The Horseshoe or Canadian Fall, as a single object, is regarded as
the sublimest thing in Nature. The Canadian Rapids have a fall of 55
feet in three-quarters of a mile before reaching the Falls, while it
is estimated that the volume of water is ten times greater than that
passing over the American Fall.</p>

<p>The height of the Horseshoe Fall is 165 feet and the stupendous
nature of the Fall is more impressive when the visitor stands at the
water’s edge in the gorge and looks upward at the flood descending in
such graceful lines.</p>

<p>The scene at Terrapin Point in winter is one of brilliancy and
splendor. The spray-cloud of the Horseshoe Fall is wafted to the
shores of Goat Island where King Winter’s breadth congeals it all to
a marble-like formation, and the snowy whiteness of the spectacle is
dazzling in the bright sunlight.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>ICE MOUNTAIN AND ICE BRIDGE.</p>

<p>The beauty of this scene varies yearly, for the wind and weather
have all to do with the magnitude of the formations. When the weather
is exceedingly cold the ice mountain, between the American Fall and the
Inclined Railway, attains a magnificent height. The ice also forms from
shore to shore, enabling people to pass at will to the Canadian side,
and forming what is popularly called the ice bridge.</p>

<p>This view shows “the dividing of the waters” of Niagara River,
and in the immediate front the American Rapids are seen flowing
tumultuously onward towards the towering cataract. Far across beyond
Goat Island are the Canadian Rapids. The greater grandeurs and
immense boundaries of which are best seen from Victoria Park on the

<p>Probably there is no one sight which impresses itself more strongly
upon the great majority of beholders than this view of the brink of
the American Fall. Such mighty on-rushing torrents, so powerful, yet
so smoothly and alluringly moving on over the precipice, and so near
is the visitor to what seems an abyss of destruction that the scene is
never forgotten.</p>

<p>This view across American Fall is one never to be forgotten. Here
the brink of the Fall is seen in all its beauty, while far across
the Fall, Prospect Park, with its constant crowds, forms part of the
picture. A fine view of the Upper Steel Bridge is also here enjoyed.</p>

<p>The Whirlpool Rapids begin within sight of the Falls. The gorge
narrows to 300 feet and the current rushes onward at a speed of
40 miles an hour and the foam-crested waters are entrancingly
beautiful.</p>

<p>The Whirlpool is about two miles below the Falls and is the greatest
known river pocket. Into it the Rapids plunge in all their fury, and a
gyrating motion is given the entire body of water. Here the river turns
at right angles, causing one of the most mysterious and fascinating
features of this mighty stream of water.</p>

<p>This is one of the grand views to be had from the Canadian side of
the river. The rapids, by their great descent and vastness, convey
an impressive effect to the mind, and, together with the Falls and
scenery of Victoria Park, combines to make one of the most pleasing
pictures about Niagara. The entire length of the park is traversed by
the electric cars, which are so great a convenience about Niagara, for
tourists.</p>

between Luna and Goat Islands. The American Fall has a width of 1,000
feet, a height of 158 feet, while the Rapids above descend forty feet
in a half mile. All visitors should go to the Canadian side for the
Canadian Fall and Rapids, the most imposing features of the Falls, are
there best seen with their wonderful rainbow and mist effects, while
the beauties of Victoria Park itself well repay a visit.</p>

<p>The life work of Niagara River has been and continues to be the
digging of the Niagara Gorge through which it flows. Those who have
studied the subject thoroughly have reached the conclusion that the
great trench was excavated by the running of the river itself. In its
length, the gorge is in one sense a measure of the age of the river.</p>

all scenic features. The objects of interest along the Gorge Route are

<p>The intensity of the mighty grasp of winter is at no point better

waters are chilled and frozen until where yesterday the river plunged
over the precipice in gleeful, laughing manner, huge stalactites of ice
are hung reaching from the cliff-top to the slope below.</p>

<p>In February, 1896, for a period of four days, the Cave of the Winds
was dry, the water of the Fall being kept back by the ice formation.
Visitors sought the cavern and roamed about admiring the icy scenes on
every side. The photograph for the picture above was then made, and it
may never be possible to obtain the same again.</p>

its gleaming walls of crystal. The entire structure was gay with

night.”</p>

<p>In winter the high winds which prevail, sometimes for days at a
time, catch the spray from the American Fall and carry it far back into
the forest growth, the trees become ice-laden, and the transformation
that takes place is beautiful in the extreme.</p>

<p class="floatr l12">THE WHITE MAN’S FANCY</p>

<p class="clear"><span class="smcap">From the famous paintings by James Francis Brown.</span></p>

<p class="floatl narrow1">To the Indians the thundering of the water
was the voice of the Great Spirit; the spray-cloud his habitation. A
portion of the crops and spoils of the chase were annually offered as
tokens, and the fairest maiden of a tribe was sacrificed by being sent
over the falls in a canoe laden with fruits and flowers.</p>

<p class="floatr narrow1">No less than the Red Man, is his successor,
the White Man, impressed with the majesty of the Creator’s power as
displayed in the grandeurs of Niagara. “Between falling flood and
rising cloud, you imagine a mystical meaning in the passage of body to
soul, of matter to spirit, of human to divine.”</p>

<p>Surrounded with an atmosphere of sentiment is this view at Niagara.
It forms an artistic and pleasing picture. Evidently at some remote
time in the past the rock has fallen from the cliff above. The famous
cave of the winds lies back of the Center Fall. It is 100 feet high,
100 feet wide and 60 feet deep.</p>
